```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

First we load the packages we will need for this vignette:

```{r}
library(ProPane)
library(Rfits)
library(Rwcs)
library(foreach)
library(magicaxis)
```

The **ProPane** package comes with key utilities for warping between different WCS systems: **propaneWarp** (for warping individual frames once). **ProPane** also contains the various functions for creating large stacks of many warped frames (which is of class *ProPane*, which is roughly meant to suggest the idea of many *panes* of glass being stacked together). 

## A Stacking Case Study

First we are going to load 8 frames of data that is included with the **ProPane** package:

```{r}
image_list = Rfits_make_list(dirlist = system.file('extdata/stack/', package="ProPane"),
                             extlist = 2) #extlist=2 because these are compressed images
```

In general the above is how you will probably load data for stacking. You can also fully load the images if the resultant list is small enough (easily fits within memory). That will be a bit faster in cases where it is possible.

Let's check the loaded image pointers. They are overlapping regions of sky:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
for(i in 1:8){
  plot(image_list[[i]])
}
```

Now we will create a target WCS for stacking (if not provided then the WCS of the first image is used instead):

```{r}
keyvalues_out = Rwcs_setkeyvalues(
    CRVAL1 = 36.8962, #Roughly the middle of the images
    CRVAL2 = -5.1906, #Roughly the middle of the images
    pixscale = 0.3, #this is a bit finer than the input pixel scale of 0.337
    NAXIS1 = 2200,
    NAXIS2 = 2200
)
```

Now we make a simple stack:

```{r}
stack = propaneStackWarpInVar(image_list = image_list,
                   inVar_list = 0.000468, #assume all have the same inVar
                   exp_list = 10, #all have the same exposure time of 10s
                   cores = 8,
                   keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out,
                   magzero_in = 30,
                   magzero_out = 23.9 #micro-jansky output
                   )
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack$image, qdiff=TRUE)
plot(stack$weight, magmap=FALSE)
```

We can see how deep most of the image is:

```{r}
table(as.integer(stack$weight$imDat)) / prod(dim(stack$weight))
```

So about 83% of the image has 8 frames contributing.

We can visually see the change in depth:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
propaneWarp(image_list[[1]][,], keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out, plot=TRUE, qdiff=TRUE)
```

We can also check the pixel statistics of the stack:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
par(mar=c(3.1,3.1,1.1,1.1))
maghist(stack$image$imDat[stack$weight$imDat==8], xlim=5)
```

This implies the sky RMS in the deepest region is about 0.039 ADU (which happens to be in micro-jansky). We can compare this to the predicted:

```{r}
1/sqrt(median(stack$inVar$imDat[stack$weight$imDat==8]))
```

This is a bit larger at about 0.046 ADU. The main source of the difference is pixel covariance, which has the effect of artificially reducing the apparent RMS.

## A Coarser Case

Now we are going to look at using a coarser pixel scale on the target WCS:

```{r}
keyvalues_out_2 = Rwcs_setkeyvalues(
    CRVAL1 = 36.8962, #Roughly the middle of the images
    CRVAL2 = -5.1906, #Roughly the middle of the images
    pixscale = 1, #this is coarser than the input pixel scale of 0.337
    NAXIS1 = 800,
    NAXIS2 = 800
)
```

First we will do a forward projection, where all source pixels are caste onto the target WCS (which is like drizzling):

```{r}
stack_2_forward = propaneStackWarpInVar(image_list = image_list,
                   inVar_list = 0.000468, #assume all have the same inVar
                   exp_list = 10, #all have the same exposure time of 10s
                   cores = 8,
                   keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out_2,
                   magzero_in = 30,
                   magzero_out = 23.9, #micro-jansky output
                   direction = 'forward'
                   )
```

Then we can try back projection, where we use the final WCS to look up input fluxes (more like Swarp):

```{r}
stack_2_backward = propaneStackWarpInVar(image_list = image_list,
                   inVar_list = 0.000468, #assume all have the same inVar
                   exp_list = 10, #all have the same exposure time of 10s
                   cores = 8,
                   keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out_2,
                   magzero_in = 30,
                   magzero_out = 23.9, #micro-jansky output
                   direction = 'backward'
                   )
```

And now let's look at them:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_2_forward$image, qdiff=TRUE)
plot(stack_2_backward$image, qdiff=TRUE)
```

Is there a different in apparent depth?

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
par(mar=c(3.1,3.1,1.1,1.1))
maghist(stack_2_forward$image$imDat, xlim=5)
par(mar=c(3.1,3.1,1.1,1.1))
maghist(stack_2_backward$image$imDat, xlim=5)
```

Indeed- the forward propagated data is deeper, which makes sense because more pixels are caste into each target pixel. The backwards stack is still deeper than a single frame since we have still stacked 8 images! The forward propagated data is however much more covariant:

```{r}
cor(as.numeric(stack_2_forward$image$imDat[1:799,1:799]),
    as.numeric(stack_2_forward$image$imDat[2:800,2:800]), use='complete.obs')
cor(as.numeric(stack_2_backward$image$imDat[1:799,1:799]),
    as.numeric(stack_2_backward$image$imDat[2:800,2:800]), use='complete.obs')
```

The default is to project from the higher resolution grid, so in this case without specifiying **Rwcs_stack** would carry out forward propagation. Which makes more sense is really a choice for the user.

## A Quick Clip

Commonly when we have multiple input frames we want to detect outlier hot/cold pixels and clip them out from the stacked image. In **Rwcs_Stack** this is achieved with the *doclip* option. To speed up the re-stacking of frames we can set *dump_frames* to TRUE (meaning warped frames are saved to a temporary directory and loaded back in as needed, saving re-projection time when ignoring clipped pixels). To see information regarding clipping we can also set *keep_extreme_pix* to TRUE.

```{r}
stack_clip = propaneStackWarpInVar(image_list = image_list,
                   inVar_list = 0.000468, #assume all have the same inVar
                   exp_list = 10, #all have the same exposure time of 10s
                   cores = 8,
                   keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out,
                   magzero_in = 30,
                   magzero_out = 23.9, #micro-jansky output
                   keep_extreme_pix = TRUE,
                   keepcrop = FALSE,
                   doclip = TRUE,
                   dump_frames = TRUE,
                   return_all = TRUE
                   )
```

The resulting stacking looks very similar, but we can see small differences:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack$image - stack_clip$image)
```

We can check the actual clipped pixels directly:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_clip$clip)
```

And we can zoom in to see the difference in more detail:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack$image[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_clip$image[1000,500,box=500])
```

In this case the clipped sources look a bit odd. We saved the input warped frames so we can check out all 8:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
for(i in 1:8){
  plot(stack_clip$image_pre_stack[[i]][1000,500,box=500])
}
```

Frames 1 and 4 seem to have unusual sources (perhaps cosmic rays) that are not present in the other frames. It is notable that our stack has not been aggressive enough in removing these bad regions, so we can tweak the *clip_tol*:

```{r}
stack_clip2 = propaneStackWarpInVar(image_list = image_list,
                   inVar_list = 0.000468, #assume all have the same inVar
                   exp_list = 10, #all have the same exposure time of 10s
                   cores = 8,
                   keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out,
                   magzero_in = 30,
                   magzero_out = 23.9, #micro-jansky output
                   keep_extreme_pix = TRUE,
                   keepcrop = FALSE,
                   doclip = TRUE,
                   clip_tol = 10,
                   dump_frames = FALSE,
                   return_all = TRUE
                   )
```
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_clip2$clip[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_clip2$image[1000,500,box=500])
```

That looks much better! The *clip_tol* is effectively the sigma clipping to apply, so setting it to a lower number like 5-10 is often sensible (the default is a deliberately very high 100).

Another route is to use the more conservative *clip_tol* but specify that we dilate around the clipped pixels (to capture bleeding around cosmic rays etc):

```{r}
stack_clip3 = propaneStackWarpInVar(image_list = image_list,
                   inVar_list = 0.000468, #assume all have the same inVar
                   exp_list = 10, #all have the same exposure time of 10s
                   cores = 8,
                   keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out,
                   magzero_in = 30,
                   magzero_out = 23.9, #micro-jansky output
                   keep_extreme_pix = TRUE,
                   keepcrop = FALSE,
                   doclip = TRUE,
                   clip_tol = 50,
                   clip_dilate = 5,
                   return_all = TRUE #This will save the warped outputs
                   )
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_clip3$clip[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_clip3$image[1000,500,box=500])
```

The best route to clipping is very much data dependent, so some experimentation from the user might be required. In general you will want to set \option{clip_tol} in the range 5-100 though.

Note if you are doing clipping on a lot of frames then it will not be feasible to run with *return_all* = TRUE since this will keep all the warped projections in memory. The better option in that case is to run with *dump_frames* = TRUE, which will save the warped frames to a temporary directory and load them as needed when applying the per-frame clipping.

## A Median Clip

You can also take the warped frames to compute a median stack. The advantage of this can be robustness to very bad data, but the caveat is that in the realm of well behaved data a median stack has an RMS larger by a factor $\sqrt{\pi/2} = 1.253$ (no such thing as money for nothing). That might not sound like a lot, but it basically means you would need to observe everything 50% longer again to get the same signal-to-noise when doing median stack (which is quite a big overhead).

```{r}
library(imager)

stack_med = propaneStackFlatFunc(stack_clip3$image_pre_stack, imager_func = parmed)
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
magimage(stack_med$image); legend('topleft', legend='Median Stack')
magimage(stack_clip3$image$imDat); legend('topleft', legend='inVar Stack')
magimage(stack_med$image - stack_clip3$image$imDat, qdiff=TRUE); legend('topleft', legend='Diff')
```

We can see there is a difference in depth when comparing the image histograms:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
par(mar=c(3.1,3.1,1.1,1.1))
maghist(stack_med$image, xlim=5)
par(mar=c(3.1,3.1,1.1,1.1))
maghist(stack_clip3$image$imDat, xlim=5)
```

The median stack as a sky RMS near to 0.049 whilst he weighted stack is deeper at 0.044. The exact ratio is complicated by the clipping removing effective frames and pixel correlation, but the difference is still quite notable.

In general median stacking is hard for large images because to do this the brute force way you need to keep all projected images in memory for the entire region, so in this case it would be eight 2,200 x 2,200 images, but for large regions (we often stack square degrees) you might have a few hundred 20,000 x 20,0000. This becomes intractable even on the biggest memory machines (e.g. that would required TBs of RAM). To solve this we implement a similar solution to Swarp where projected frames saved on disk are median stacked in chunks and the contiguous image is then put back together at the end.

We can make use of the frames we have already dumped to do this with *Rwcs_stack_median*:

```{r}
stack_med2 = propaneStackWarpMed(dirlist = stack_clip$dump_dir,
                                 keyvalues_out = keyvalues_out,
                                 cores = 8,
                                 pattern = glob2rx('*image*fits') #to only stack images
                                 )
```

And now we can compare the region with the bad cosmic rays:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack$image[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_clip2$image[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_clip3$image[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_med2$image[1000,500,box=500])
```

In general the best quality data will come from using clipped inverse variance weighted stacks (since it will remove the outliers and keep the higher $S/N$), but if little is known about the data then a median might be the best practical solution, being quite robust to artefacts and not requiring data specific clipping tuning (**clip_tol**, **clip_dilate** etc).

To help automate this patching process we can use the *propanePatch* function. Here we use our worst (not clipped) image and combine with the median stack:

```{r}
stack_patch = propanePatch(image_inVar = stack$image, image_med = stack_med2$image)
```

Note we just run with defaults, but there are quite a few options to determine optimal patching- most importantly the **threshold** (where lower mean more patching with the median combined image). We can also specify just patching **hot** or **cold** pixels (if you are very certain only certain types of bad pixel exist in the data).

Relatively few very pixels in the `stack$image` are replaced with stack_med2$image value using the default arguments (0.14%). We can see the resulting patched image and check which pixels were replaced:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_patch$image[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_patch$patch[1000,500,box=500], qdiff=T)
```

Now we can see if we see much difference using the already clipped version:

```{r}
stack_patch3 = propanePatch(image_inVar = stack_clip3$image, image_med = stack_med2$image)
```

And we again check the patched plots:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_patch3$image[1000,500,box=500])
plot(stack_patch3$patch[1000,500,box=500], qdiff=TRUE)
```

And finally lets check the differences in the patched images:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, dpi=40}
plot(stack_patch$image[1000,500,box=500] - stack_patch3$image[1000,500,box=500], qdiff=TRUE)
```

This would suggest a marginal preference for the clipped and patched version of the image.
